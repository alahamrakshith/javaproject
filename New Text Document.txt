# INTRODUCTION
This is a sample program for managing and running the rides in an Amusement park. This program has two approaches
i)	Admin Approach
ii)	Guest Approach.
The Admin approach focuses on the Database Management and the ability to control and monitor rides in an Amusement park
The Guest Approach enables the guests the create an ID which further enables them to access rides depending on the age restriction of the rides and the availability.
The main aim of this project is to implement all the concepts of JAVA which is focused upon during the duration of our course.
# CURRENT WORK
The program is designed to handle the free flow of customers entering an Amusement park by providing basic details of the rides available in the Amusement park and by allowing them to choose the rides they wish to take.
Different databases have been created for Customer details and the Log of each ride in the Amusement park which contains the list of people who have taken a specific ride.
Admin access has been created with the help of an interface to maintain abstraction and the program enables the admin user to control all the rides in the amusement park and has view and edit access to all the databases relating to the amusement park.
# FUTURE WORK
We plan to implement Hotel Room booking facility for the customers if they are interested in the same.
We also plan on implementing a feedback system which accepts valuable data from customers regarding how the Amusement park can be improved in different ways possible.
